# 🩺 Lung Cancer Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts lung cancer severity levels using a machine learning model trained on patient health data. It utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** to classify patient risk levels based on symptoms, habits, and medical history.

## 🎬 Demo Notebook

📓 **Platform:** Google Colab
📁 Model Export: `lung_model.pkl` (downloadable)
📊 Dataset: `cancer patient data sets.csv`

---

## 📌 Features

🔍 Predicts **lung cancer severity** (e.g., Low, Medium, High)
🧠 Trains a **Random Forest Classifier**
🧾 Supports **18+ features** like Smoking, Chest Pain, Shortness of Breath
📈 Achieves **100% accuracy** (on this specific dataset)
💾 Saves trained model as a `.pkl` file
🌐 Easy to deploy with Flask or Streamlit frontend

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* `pandas` – data handling
* `scikit-learn` – model training & evaluation
* `LabelEncoder` – to encode categorical labels
* `pickle` – for saving the model
* `Google Colab` – development environment

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional for GitHub Deployment)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-prediction.git
cd lung-cancer-prediction
```

### 2. Upload Data in Colab

Upload your `cancer patient data sets.csv` via:

```python
from google.colab import files
files.upload()
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if running locally)

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## ⚙️ Model Training Steps

1. Load dataset and preprocess (`LabelEncoder`)
2. Select relevant features (`X`) and label (`y`)
3. Split data using `train_test_split`
4. Train `RandomForestClassifier`
5. Evaluate accuracy using `accuracy_score`
6. Save trained model using `pickle`

---

## ✅ Model Accuracy

🎯 **Achieved Accuracy:** `100%`
⚠️ Note: This may be due to a clean, small, or imbalanced dataset. Always validate on real-world data.

---

## 🧪 Sample Code

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

## 💡 Potential Extensions

* 📱 Build a web app (Flask / Streamlit)
* 📊 Add visualizations for patient risk
* 🧪 Improve model with more diverse data
* 🧮 Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
